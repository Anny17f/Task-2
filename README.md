Git and GitHub are related but different. Here is a detailed explanation:
Git:
Git is a distributed version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is now maintained by the Linux kernel community.
Version control systems are software tools that help programmers manage changes to their code over time. It is commonly used for source code management in software development, but it can also be used to track changes in any set of files.
Git tracks changes by taking a snapshot of the changes in your code every time you commit. It is called a "distributed" version control system because it allows you to work on different branches of your project simultaneously. This feature helps teams to work on their project together and independently.

GitHub:
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control using Git. It offers all the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
The most prominent feature of GitHub is the ability to create public or private repositories for your projects. Public repositories are available for everyone to view, fork, and contribute to. Private repositories require a user to have access permissions.
GitHub also provides a collaboration platform called "Pull Requests." It allows users to propose changes to a project and to review and discuss those changes with the project's community before they are merged into the project's codebase.
GitHub is also home to thousands of open-source projects. It allows developers to easily find open-source projects, view their source code, and contribute to them.
GitHub provides additional features such as bug tracking, automated testing, and wikis. It is commonly used in the open-source community but is also widely used by private companies.

In summary, Git is a distributed version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform that utilizes Git to provide version control and additional features. You can use Git without GitHub, but GitHub significantly enhances your ability to use Git.
